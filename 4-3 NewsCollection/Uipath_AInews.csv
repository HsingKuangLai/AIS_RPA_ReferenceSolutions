UiPath will showcase its latest capabilities at UiPath on Tour London: AI at Work summit on July 2 at the InterContinental London. UiPath Autopilot™ for developers and testersIn the digital enterprise, rapid development and testing speeds are a top priority. UiPath delivers on the promise of AI-powered productivity with the release of UiPath Autopilot™ for developers and testers.UiPath Autopilot for developers uses the power of GenAI and natural language processing (NLP) in UiPath Studio to create workflows, generate expressions, and help build automations. With an over 70% acceptance rate, Autopilot for developers text to workflow is making things easier for less experienced developers and speeding up scaffolding for experienced developers. It delivers:Text to workflow: developers can simply describe an automation idea in natural language, and Autopilot will create the initial workflow.Text to expressions: with Autopilot, developers no longer need to remember the exact syntax and structure of expressions. They can describe what they need in natural language and allow AI to generate the correct expression.Text to code: generate code from natural language descriptions to shorten time to deployment for automation projects.PDF form, text, or image to UiPath Apps: in UiPath Apps, Autopilot enables developers to quickly create a new app—either from a PDF file or from an image of a paper form.UiPath Autopilot for testers accelerates every aspect of software testing by leveraging GenAI to refine and improve requirements, generate step-by-step tests from those requirements, and uses those tests to create coded automations. It provides:Quality checks: Autopilot analyzes and evaluates requirements to ensure they are clear, consistent, and complete.Test design: from those requirements and supporting docs, Autopilot generates manual tests with step-by-step instructions.Test automation: Autopilot converts any text, such as manual tests, into automated tests in UiPath Studio with little to no effort.Test insights: Autopilot provides real-time, actionable insights into the test case portfolio to offer continuous improvement. UiPath plugin and integration with Copilot for Microsoft 365Now in preview, the integration enables joint customers to automate end-to-end business processes with co-workers directly within Microsoft Teams. Customers will have access to a prebuilt automation library to run automations that complete common, repetitive tasks, along with specialized automations for function- or industry-specific tasks. Users can also discover and run automations their company has developed.New AI enhancements for IDPUiPath is committed to building the best-in-class AI models for core business tasks. At UiPath On Tour London, the company released new AI enhancements for intelligent document processing (IDP) capabilities, including:UiPath DocPath and CommPath: specialized large language models (LLMs) enabling out-of-the-box processing of any document or message, with increased accuracy, speed, and scale. Both LLMs are now in general availability.Active learning: reduced training effort by 80% with the introduction of active learning techniques. Now, anyone can easily train their own models with active guidance from AI; no machine learning or coding skills are required.Generative validation: use GenAI to validate Document Understanding model outputs. Generative validation offers a “second opinion” on the data extracted from documents, reducing the workload of human annotators. This reduces the time spent on human validation, decreases average handling time, and boosts automation rates by up to 200%.AI-powered building blocksUiPath is using AI to simplify and improve higher-level automation tasks. GenAI activitiesare a curated collection of activities that simplify common GenAI use cases for automation developers, including:Content generation: generates a chat response for the provided request using chat completion models.PII filtering: scans the input text, identifies any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Protected Health Information (PHI), and replaces such data with a redaction marker.Summarize text: summarizes text using an LLM.Translate: detects and reports the language of any given text.Object Detection: identifies and locates objects within images for tasks like automated inspections or data collection.Image Classification: categorizes images into predefined classes to support processes like sorting products or analyzing documents.Categorize: organizes data into categories for improved analysis and decision making in workflows.Named Entity Recognition: extracts specific entities (like names, places, and dates) from text, aiding in information retrieval and organization. In addition, Intelligent UI form-handling capabilities leverage UiPath specialized AI and the learnings from Clipboard AI. These activities accelerate development and reduce maintenance as they deal with a form as a single entity, rather than a collection of individual fields. They include:Form fill: uses AI to complete a form. Given input data and a form, the activity will use AI to map data to the available input fields, fill in the data, and submit the form.Form copy: uses AI to read the data from a form. Given a target form, the activity will use AI to extract data and map it to a derived data structure.Set value: uses AI to input data into a single field.All activities use the UiPath Trust Layer, ensuring customers can use GenAI-powered capabilities with the confidence that company data and policies govern them.UiPath Automation Cloud™ availability in the UKAt UiPath on Tour London, the company also announced the general availability of UiPath Automation Cloud™ on Microsoft Azure in the UK, driven by high customer demand for local data residency and a growing need for AI and automation from UiPath. UiPath is supporting numerous organizations in the UK to safely deploy AI-powered automation programs and reach their digital transformation goals. The expansion will enable public sector organizations, as well as customers in a wide range of industries such as financial services, healthcare, and telecommunications and others, to better comply with regulation linked to handling sensitive customer data."
New Global Survey Finds Enterprises Lack Direction and Training for Workers on the Use of GenAI Tools,"JUNE 11, 2024",https://www.uipath.com/newsroom/uipath-unveils-global-knowledge-worker-survey-findings,"New Global Survey Finds Enterprises Lack Direction and Training for Workers on the Use of GenAI Tools Annual UiPath survey finds employees believe GenAI tools have greater context when combined with business automationNEW YORK, NY, June 11, 2024—UiPath (NYSE: PATH), a leading enterprise automation and AI software company, today published its annual Global Knowledge Worker Survey that uncovers how employees are using generative AI (GenAI), the shortcomings and risks of the technology, and the opportunity for combining GenAI with business automation. The report—which is based on a survey of more than 9,000 workers from around the world—revealed that employees who use GenAI tools are saving more time in their workdays. However, those using both GenAI and business automation together achieve substantially more significant benefits. While GenAI promises to revolutionize operations across industries, there is a lack of enterprise direction and training on the technology, leading to mistrust across global workforces. Currently, less than half (45%) of workers have been offered training or guidelines on how to use GenAI. Similarly, only 44% of employees think that GenAI has the context needed from their business’s data to support processes and drive value—though this number increases to 85% when employees use GenAI and business automation together.Other key findings from this year’s report: GenAI provides significant time-saving benefits to workers: 42% of respondents who have implemented GenAI have saved 10 or more hours each week. By freeing up time in their days, almost half of workers (48%) have been able to focus on more creative tasks. Regionally, workers in Singapore and Hong Kong have seen the greatest time-saving benefits from implementing GenAI tools.The combination of GenAI and business automation maximizes the business value: When asked if employees have experienced any benefits from using GenAI and business automation software, respondents said greater productivity/get tasks done faster (43%), more accurate work (39%), and improved work/life balance (38%). When workers use the technologies together, 55% saved 10+ hours at work per week, compared to 31% of those who use only GenAI and 33% of those who use only business automation.However, there is a lack of trust around GenAI tools: Less than half (48%) of respondents indicate that they trust the outputs they get from GenAI tools. Regionally, Japan (26%), Germany (47%), and the U.S. (48%) trust GenAI’s outputs the least, and Singapore (67%), Korea (63%), and Hong Kong (62%) have the greatest trust in GenAI's outputs. GenAI is being applied across departments and for a variety of processes: The most common types of tasks employees use GenAI for include drafting communications (38%), brainstorming (34%), and summarizing long-form content (30%).Brigette McInnis-Day, Chief People Officer at UiPath, said:GenAI tools are presenting an incredible opportunity for organizations to increase productivity and efficiencies, but employees must be provided with the proper training and upskilling opportunities to harness the full power of this technology. The technology must also be trusted and actionable—which is where business automation platforms serve as a critical foundation. The combination of these two technologies is a key differentiator for companies to maximize business value from GenAI and other AI models while empowering employees.The UiPath survey also uncovered that employees are feeling more burnout than ever before, with almost a third (32%) of respondents feeling extremely or very burnt out—compared to 29% of employees last year. GenAI presents an opportunity to alleviate the burdensome tasks that contribute to this issue; however, GenAI deployments will only be successful if workers are trained.To view the full findings of the report, download the complete 2024 UiPath Global Knowledge Worker Survey here. MethodologyIn partnership with Researchscape, UiPath conducted this research via an online survey that was fielded in March–April 2024. There were 9,047 respondents to the survey from nine countries: the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom."
